# javascript-quiz

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a multiple choice question quiz using WEB APIS in javascript. If the player chooses the correct answer points are added to their score. If the player chooses the wrong answer, time is deducted from their score. The player can also submit their high scores and still have them rendered on the page the next time they play the game.

## Description
•The first step entails creating the multiple choice questions and giving the answer buttons specific ids so they will either add points or subtract time.
• We then enable the timer to start once the start quiz button is clicked.
• As the player traverses through the questions they are either gaining ten points or losing five seconds on the clock.
• At the end of the game the player can enter their high score and then restart the game if they choose.
